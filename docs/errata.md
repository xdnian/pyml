The *Known Errors* Leaderboard
========================

I tried my best to cut all the little typos, errors, and formatting bugs that slipped through the copy editing stage. Even so, I think it is just human to have a little typo here and there in a first edition. I know that this can be annoying as a reader, and I was thinking to associate it with something positive. Let's have a little leaderboard (inspired by Donald Knuth's "[Known Errors in My Books](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/books.html)").

Every error that is not listed in the *Errata* yet will be rewarded with $0.10. I am a man of my word, but I want to be a little bit careful with the initial amount; I will probably increase it soon depending on how it goes.

The only catch here is that you won't receive any single cent. Instead, I am going to donate the amount to [UNICEF USA](http://www.unicefusa.org), the US branch of the United Nations agency for raising funds to provide emergency food and healthcare for children in developing countries.

I would be happy if you just write me a short [mail](mailto:mail@sebastianraschka.com) including the error and page number, and please let me know if you want to be listed on the public leaderboard.
