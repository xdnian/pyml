The *Known Errors* Leaderboard
========================

I tried my best to cut all the little typos, errors, and formatting bugs that slipped through the copy editing stage. Even so, I think it is just human to have a little typo here and there in a first edition. I know that this can be annoying as a reader, and I was thinking to associate it with something positive. Let's have a little leaderboard (inspired by Donald Knuth's "[Known Errors in My Books](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/books.html)").

Every error that is not listed in the *Errata* yet will be rewarded with $0.25. I am a man of my word, but I want to be a little bit careful with the initial amount; I will probably increase it soon depending on how it goes.

The only catch here is that you won't receive any single cent. Instead, I am going to donate the amount to [UNICEF USA](http://www.unicefusa.org), the US branch of the United Nations agency for raising funds to provide emergency food and healthcare for children in developing countries.

I would be happy if you just write me a short [mail](mailto:mail@sebastianraschka.com) including the error and page number, and please let me know if you want to be listed on the public leaderboard.

## Donations

- Current amount for the next donation: $1.50
- Amount donated to charity: $0.00

### Technical Notes

I am really sorry about you seeing many typos up in the equations so far. Unfortunately, the layout team needed to retype the equations for compatibility reasons. There were a lot of typos introduced during this process, and I tried my very best to eliminate all of these by comparing the pre-finals against my draft. Cross-comparing 450 pages was a tedious task, and it appears that several typos slipped through, so if you see something that does not make quite sense to you, please let me know.   
 
 

**Chapter 2**

- p. 20: Since we brought &theta; to the left, it should be "1 if z &#8805; 0" and not  "1 if z &#8805; &theta;" anymore
- p. 22:  *y<sup>(i)</sup>* is set to *1<sup>(i)</sup>*, rather it should be just *1* (T.S. Jayram)
- p. 25:  The link to `matplotlib` is misspelled, it should be http://matplotlib.org/users/beginner.html instead of http://matplotlib.org/ussers/beginner.html (T.S. Jayram)
- p. 35:  In the context "... update the weights by taking a step away from the gradient &nabla; J(w) ... weight change  &Delta;w defined as the negative gradient multiplied by the earning rate &eta; : &Delta; w = −&eta;&Delta;J(w)."  --> "&Delta;w = −&eta;&Delta;J(w)" should be "&Delta;w = −&eta;&nabla;J(w)"

### Language

**Preface**

- p. x: the phrase "--whether you want start from..." should be  "--whether you want to start from..."

**Chapter 2**

- p. 19: there should be a period between "otherwise" and "in" (this is towards the end of the page)
