ex01	[100.00 / 100.00]
	Well done! (20+30+50)

ex02	[100.00 / 100.00]
	Good job, 50+50.

ex03	[94.00 / 100.00]
	(15+9+30+40)
	Q1: not complete, the final solution could be more general in a unified way.
	Q2: Good. Q3+Q4: Good job.

ex04	[85.00 / 100.00]
	50+50: Well done! But it is 2 hours 52 mins late, so 100*(1-0.15)=85.

ex05	[100.00 / 100.00]
	20+40+40: 
	For Q1: good. 
	For Q2: good plotting and analysis. 
	For Q3: Good! 
	Good job for assignment 5!

ex06	[77.00 / 100.00]
	32+45: 
	For Q1: Good experiments, just one point need to be better, the mis-cluster visualization plot could be more tight, and there should not appear empty image blocks in the end. 
	For Q2: The models should be improved more to gain higher accuracy for such challenging assignment. We expected more in-depth experiments/comparisons/analysis for such a challenging assignment ��Describe the experimental process you took to arrive at the solution. For example: (1) compare your approach against other approach(es) you have tried, as well as the MLP baseline classifer. (2) compare against different settings of model parameters, e.g. regularization type/strength, number of hidden units or structure of a neural network, types of kernel in a SVM, etc.�� So if more models and different settings are experimented and compared, that is much better, as 50% accuracy is a bit low for such task. That is why we set this assignment to be one-month long.
